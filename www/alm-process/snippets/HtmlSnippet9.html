Web Toolkit (GWT)</a> is an open source Java software development
framework that makes writing AJAX applications (...) easy for
developers who don't speak browser quirks as a second language. Writing
dynamic web applications today is a tedious and error-prone process;
you spend 90% of your time working around subtle incompatibilities
between web browsers and platforms, and JavaScript's lack of modularity
makes sharing, testing, and reusing AJAX components difficult and
fragile.
<p> GWT lets you avoid many of these headaches while offering
your users the same dynamic, standards-compliant experience. You write
your front end in the Java programming language, and the GWT compiler
converts your Java classes to browser-compliant JavaScript and HTML. </p>
